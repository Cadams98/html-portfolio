<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, I'm Christian Adams, a passionate computer science and information systems professional and a proud father of
  two. With an associate’s degree in Computer Information Systems under my belt, I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s
  degree in Computer Science at Florida State University. My journey into the tech world began during my childhood,
  where I found myself fascinated by the inner workings of games like Halo 2 and 3, often experimenting with server
  setups and plugin modifications.
</p>

<p>
  From these early experiences, I developed a strong curiosity and desire to understand and build complex systems. Today,
  I channel that passion into software development, with a growing expertise in Python, systems integration, and
  user-friendly GUI design. I am committed to constantly expanding my knowledge and honing my skills, whether it's
  developing software applications or troubleshooting intricate electronic systems.
</p>

<p>
  In a professional setting, I am known for my persistence, teamwork, and ability to tackle challenges head-on. My goal
  is to contribute to innovative tech projects that drive progress and efficiency, while continuing to grow both
  personally and professionally. I am actively seeking internship opportunities where I can bring my dedication and
  technical skills to the table, while gaining real-world experience in the tech field.

  Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to the opportunity to connect and collaborate on exciting projects!
